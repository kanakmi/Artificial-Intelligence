# Stock Sentiment Analysis
In this project I've trained a Dense Deep Learning Model that predicts whether a sentiment related to a stock is positive or negetive. Analising people's sentiments related to a particular stock helps us in determining whether the value of that stock would go up or down the next day. Hence, by analising the sentiments, we could maximise our profits and minimise the risk associated with that particular stock.
