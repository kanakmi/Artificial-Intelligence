## Facial Key Points
This Deep Learning Model uses a Convolutional Neural Network to identify the position of Key Facial Points such as Eyes, Nose, and Mouth with an accuracy of 82%.
Furthermore, it uses the previously trained Facial Expression Model and makes predictions on the testing data using both the models together.
