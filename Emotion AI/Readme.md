# Emotion AI

## 1. Facial Expression
This Deep Learning Model uses a Convolutional Neural Network to predict the Emotion an image depicts with an accuracy of 75% on the testing data.

## 2. Facial Key Points
This Deep Learning Model uses a Convolutional Neural Network to identify the position of Key Facial Points such as Eyes, Nose, and Mouth with an accuracy of 82%.
Furthermore, it uses the previously trained Facial Expression Model and makes predictions on the testing data using both the models together.

## 3. Prediction on Personal Image
In this Notebook, I used my Image and feeded it into the model and then made the final Prediction using both the Models.
